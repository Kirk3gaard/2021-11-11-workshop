## Description

A bunch of samples were submitted for amplicon sequencing. 

## Tasks

* Install the [ampvis2](https://github.com/MadsAlbertsen/ampvis2/) package.
* Create a boxplot of the 5 most abundant phyla grouped by soil type
* Create a heatmap of the ten most abundant ASVs
* How many samples are there for each soil type?
* IS there any relationship between soil type and pH?
* What is the most abundant family?
* Remember to comment what you find.

## Load packages

```{r loadlibraries,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ampvis2)
library(kableExtra)
options(scipen = 10)
```

## Load data

```{r loaddata,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Load ASV data
AMP <- readRDS(file.path("data/AMP.rds"))
```

## What does the data look like?

```{r showdata,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
AMP
```
